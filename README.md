I apologize for the low quality video.It looks and the sound was much better than my tablet cam gives justice.

## Material:

- 1 IKEA Moslanda 115cm picture shelf (black)
- 1 Arduino Uno
- 1 Transformer
- 2 1M 30 Pixel/M WS2812 LED strips (total of 52 LEDs required)
- 26 3/4" Thick Perspex Cast Acrylic Blocks 5" x 3"
- 1 MAX9814 Microphone Amplifier Module AGC Auto Gain Control for Arduino
- 1 470 ohm resistor
- 1 10k ohm resistor
- 1 100 uf capaitor
- 1 0.1 uf capacitor
- 1 Rocker Switch Package (L x W x H) 5.0 x 2.8 x 0.8 in. (see images folder)
- 1 Pushbutton Switch Package (L x W x H) 2.4 x 1.4 x 1.2 in. (see images folder)
- 1 48 in. x 3/4 in. x 1/16 in. Aluminum Square Tube
- 10 #8 Pan Head Sheet Metal Screws

## Printables:

- 26 Perspex Mount*
- 8 Led Strip Retainer
- 2 Center Support (minimum 2, additional supports can be added to increase stability across span 6 or 8 recommended)
- 1 Left Angular End
- 1 Right Angular End
- 1 Center Connection Junction
- 1 Arduino Screwless Hobby Top
- 1 Arduino Uno Mountable Bottom

Attention was paid to ensuring all pieces will print without support. There are fine design details to enhance FDM bridging abilities.

*Perspex is cast clear acrylic and as such will vary slightly in thickness. 3 Mount widths are provided to match to the width of your pieces for a snug fit. Before printing you must measure the thickness of each block and print the appropriate width to fit.*

Constructing this is undeniably an undertaking but I never underestimate the maker community's willingness to create astoundingly complex and wonderful things. I posted the entire circuit diagram and sketch to Autodesk Circuit but in my attempt to link it, it appears to have vanished in the move to Tinkercad. If there is enough interest I will recreate it on Tinkercad as well as discuss the assembly process. You will need an accurate means to saw finely cut slots in the IKEA shelf as this forms the basis for mounting and aligning the block retainers. There's a few skills involved but nothing insurmountable. Other than the cuts and soldering, everything else snaps,slides or screws together.

Note the sketch and light bar design uses 13 WS2812 per strip versus the 12 shown in the circuit diagram as this is a limitation of Tinkercad. I have provided a link to the light bar project in Tinkercad. Unfortunately there's problem with Tinckercad running the sketch that run fine in simulation in Autodesk Circuits before it became Tinkercad. The signal generator was used since the site cannot simulate a MAX9814 but provides input similarly.
